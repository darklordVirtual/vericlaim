"""Cost-aware routing: pick the cheapest model that still meets each request's
quality floor.

The knowledge domain is *cost-aware routing*: an assurance service that calls
LLMs (embeddings, rerankers, generation) should not send every request to the
most expensive model. Given a price/quality table and per-request quality
floors, route each request to the cheapest model that clears its floor, and
measure the saving against an always-premium baseline — while proving no request
is ever served below its floor.

The price table, quality scores and workload are SYNTHETIC and fixed: this
demonstrates the routing policy and its saving/soundness guarantees, not real
model prices or real model quality.
